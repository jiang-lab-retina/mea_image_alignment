# Image MEA Dulce

**Image processing program for Multi-Electrode Array (MEA) data alignment with GUI interface**

## Overview

Image MEA Dulce is a scientific image processing tool designed for aligning and analyzing microscopy data from Multi-Electrode Array experiments. The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface that allows researchers to configure key processing parameters and perform reproducible data alignment operations.

## Features

- **Data Alignment**: Advanced image alignment algorithms for MEA microscopy data
- **GUI Interface**: User-friendly interface for parameter configuration and visualization
- **Reproducible Processing**: All processing operations are fully reproducible with saved configurations
- **Data Integrity**: Original raw data is never modified; all processing operates on copies
- **Quality Validation**: Built-in quality metrics and validation for processing results

## Supported Formats

- **Primary**: `.czi` (Carl Zeiss Image format) - native microscopy data format
- **Additional formats**: TBD based on requirements

## Project Status

🚧 **In Development** - Constitution and architectural guidelines established

## Architecture Principles

This project follows strict architectural principles documented in the [Constitution](./.specify/memory/constitution.md):

1. **Data Integrity First**: Preservation of scientific data throughout all processing
2. **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive interface with real-time feedback
3. **Reproducible Processing**: Full reproducibility with parameter tracking
4. **Validation & Quality Control**: Automated quality assessment
5. **Modular Architecture**: Separation of processing logic from GUI

## Getting Started
